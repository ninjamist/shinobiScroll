Feb 24 00:13:30 <BrianTheDog>	why are you here if not to chat?
Feb 24 00:13:46 <BrianTheDog>	bunch of nick parkers
Feb 24 00:13:52 <Empus>	Settle down, BrianTheDog.  People have lives, they eat, they sleep, they work.
Feb 24 00:13:59 <bogghi[BDAY]>	I know that, I was joking with the order
Feb 24 00:14:06 <Bodoo>	Happy birthday bogghi[BDAY] !

Feb 24 00:14:20 <Empus>	you're very wrong

Feb 24 00:14:22 <BrianTheDog>	as most undernet channels are
Feb 24 00:14:36 <Bodoo>	perfect weekend day for party :D
Feb 24 00:14:36 <BrianTheDog>	when is the active tim?
Feb 24 00:14:39 <BrianTheDog>	+e
Feb 24 00:14:43 <bogghi[BDAY]>	BrianTheDog that is not true 
Feb 24 00:15:06 <BrianTheDog>	ok, what time of day is the chat active usually?
Feb 24 00:15:18 <BrianTheDog>	cause i have been to many channels
Feb 24 00:15:35 <BrianTheDog>	and nothing ever happens
Feb 24 00:15:38 <Empus>	Maybe they go quiet when you arrive
Feb 24 00:15:47 <BrianTheDog>	doubtful
Feb 24 00:15:53 <bogghi[BDAY]>	Bodoo , yes , I have a party in the garden, I have some guests today at noon, barbecue time baby! 
Feb 24 00:16:12 <BrianTheDog>	you're not a nice person, is my feeling, Empus
Feb 24 00:16:17 <bogghi[BDAY]>	:))
Feb 24 00:16:20 <BrianTheDog>	have i offended you?
Feb 24 00:16:27 <bogghi[BDAY]>	BrianTheDog you are really really wrong
Feb 24 00:16:42 <Bodoo>	have fun and enjoy bogghi[BDAY]
Feb 24 00:16:47 <Empus>	You've come in with an attitude and making wrongful assumptions.  I'm correcting you, and suggesting that your attitude may be turning people off

Feb 24 00:17:53 <Bodoo>	not everyone is from your time zone :) for example in my place now is 7 am
Feb 24 00:18:02 <Empus>	Expecting people to be active every time you are is bound to be disappointing
Feb 24 00:18:03 <BrianTheDog>	i come into a chat channel and expect chatters
Feb 24 00:18:04 <Empus>	heh
Feb 24 00:18:11 <BrianTheDog>	is that wrong?
Feb 24 00:18:39 <BrianTheDog>	then i guess i'm wrong
Feb 24 00:18:46 <Empus>	maybe it's better to want chatting, rather than expecting it
Feb 24 00:18:52 <BrianTheDog>	have fun

May 13 03:54:11 <kp0w>	I don't know, maybe americans who haven't been to the EU or have tried EU chocolate would be blind enough to think freedoms chocolate is the best
May 13 03:54:15 <kp0w>	Appocomaster do it
May 13 03:54:29 <Appocomaster>	lactose intolerant and can't stand too much dark chocolate, so ..

May 13 03:55:10 <Appocomaster>	but on the other hand, travelling for work, so if I'm going to be playing the arse trumpet all night, this week is a good week for that
