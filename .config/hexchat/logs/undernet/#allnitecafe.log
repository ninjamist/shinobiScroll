Nov 20 23:17:24 <Rocz>	What's your preferred method for cooking bacon? Pan fry or baking?
Nov 20 23:17:31 <GamerTony>	pan fry!
Nov 20 23:18:36 <Rocz>	That puzzles me. You can load an entire pound of bacon and cook it without fussing around.
Nov 20 23:19:06 <GamerTony>	true but it tastes better pan fried
Nov 20 23:19:22 <GamerTony>	just dont do it naked!
Nov 20 23:19:29 *	GamerTony cackles
Nov 20 23:20:11 <Rocz>	I do agree it tastes better because it cooks in it's own fat.
Nov 20 23:20:37 <GamerTony>	baked cooks it slowly, pan frying cooks it viciously lawl
Nov 20 23:20:50 <Rocz>	LAWL!
Nov 20 23:21:28 <Rocz>	Would you eat sausage cooked in hog intestine?

Nov 20 23:23:57 <Willux>	sausage cooked in hog intestine. That sounds fascinating
Nov 20 23:24:09 <Willux>	it's a good thing I have some red wine ready if I ever get a chance to eat it :D
Nov 20 23:24:28 <Rocz>	Is your wife vegan?
Nov 20 23:25:31 <Willux>	she is not
Nov 20 23:25:46 <Rocz>	Good!
Nov 20 23:25:57 <Willux>	before giving birth she was also blessed with an amazing metabolism
Nov 20 23:26:02 <Willux>	she can eat so much and stills tay skinny
Nov 20 23:26:12 <Rocz>	You can enjoy pig like the rest!
Nov 20 23:28:27 <Willux>	I actually went to a friend's kid's baptism, and they had filipino food, and one of the dishes was, I kid you not, a full roasted pig
Nov 20 23:28:43 <Rocz>	Lechon!
Nov 20 23:28:53 <Willux>	yes!
Nov 20 23:29:08 <Rocz>	I would have gone hog wild!
Nov 20 23:29:10 <Willux>	that's what it was called
Nov 20 23:29:18 <Willux>	I was fascinated. I have never seen a full cooked pig like that before :D

Nov 22 23:22:03 <Smurfette30>	hi Rob_M
Nov 22 23:22:31 <Archer^>	Smurfette30 - that's okay.  My rule is, the moment you add pineapple, it ceases to be a pizza.   :-)
Nov 22 23:22:52 *	Rob_M has quit (Quit)
Nov 22 23:23:04 <Abhartach>	I like sausage, pepperoni and mushrooms
Nov 22 23:23:07 <Archer^>	but you can still have your pineapple, Smurfette30
Nov 22 23:23:17 <Smurfette30>	lol thanks Archer^
Nov 22 23:23:26 <Mac_LaBrea>	a masochist would go double sardines
Nov 22 23:23:29 <Archer^>	Ahhh, Abhartach, we can be frenemies again!
Nov 22 23:23:41 <Smurfette30>	i dont always have pineapple on pizza, depends what i feel like but definately no sardines
Nov 22 23:24:10 <Abhartach>	I actually meant anchovies but close enough
Nov 22 23:24:45 <Abhartach>	"Oh, but NO anchovies, and I mean NO anchovies. You put anchovies on this thing and you're in big trouble, okay?"
Nov 22 23:24:45 <Archer^>	I know Smurfette30.  I'm pretty sure I'm in the minority on this one.  But, there is some kind of debate going on.
Nov 22 23:24:58 <Smurfette30>	no fish at all on pizza, thats wrong on so many levels

Nov 22 23:25:55 <Smurfette30>	how was your day Kanguru?
Nov 22 23:25:59 <Archer^>	I'm a fan of fish, but it doesn't *seem* like it belongs on a pizza.  Therefore .. BANNED!!!!    I think that's reasonable, no?
Nov 22 23:26:09 <Kanguru>	it was ok
Nov 22 23:26:21 <Smurfette30>	thats reasonable Archer^
Nov 22 23:26:36 <Smurfette30>	as long as its in a seperate box
Nov 22 23:26:44 <Kanguru>	it could have been warmer and dryer

Nov 22 23:29:07 <Smurfette30>	lol
Nov 22 23:29:30 <Smurfette30>	i shouldnt laugh, what does that say about my sense of humour?

Nov 22 23:38:49 <Archer^>	Oh, but it may have been.  Is okay though, being a failure isn't on you.  I allowed it to happen.

Nov 22 23:39:59 <Archer^>	I can believe that.  What don't you fail to do, exactly?
Nov 22 23:40:34 <Smurfette30>	is that you asking what i do for work?
Nov 22 23:41:17 <Archer^>	It's me, asking what are the "slim" chances that you're mildly good enough, to be paid to do?
Nov 22 23:41:43 <Smurfette30>	i work with kids
Nov 22 23:41:51 <Archer^>	I feel like there are kinda ways that I could have asked that.
Nov 22 23:42:26 <Smurfette30>	they entrust me to help raise some of the next generation, luckily for them, im mildly good at it
Nov 22 23:42:45 <Archer^>	You work with kids?  See, now this remove any ... like, I can't be mean now.

Nov 23 01:08:39 <Rocz>	Well, for example, they could have made it very clear that they figured it was going to be dropped on Germany. Or the Air Force deliberately didn't bomb certain citys to fully judge the unblemished effects.

Mar 30 23:07:29 <Mac_LaBrea>	Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!
Mar 30 23:07:41 <xina>	I need my glasses
Mar 30 23:08:27 <xina>	All was OK then :)
Mar 30 23:09:11 <xina>	Audience laughed
Mar 30 23:09:31 <xina>	Just a show
Mar 30 23:09:38 <xina>	:)
Mar 30 23:10:01 <Mac_LaBrea>	Charles Keating was the guy from Ohio who got caught up in the S&L scandal.  Same guy who went after Larry Flynt.
Mar 30 23:11:18 <Rocz>	That is correct! Keating was a former mayor of Cincinnati.
Mar 30 23:11:37 <Mac_LaBrea>	Jerry was not corrupt, just sensational
Mar 30 23:11:38 <Rocz>	Sorry. I made an error.
Mar 30 23:14:40 <xina>	Did someone state that Springer was corrupt?
Mar 30 23:15:27 <Mac_LaBrea>	well, that's what the S&L scandal implies......  maybe that was before your day xina
Mar 30 23:15:36 <Rocz>	I mistook him for another Ohio guy that bilked the tax payers out of millions.
Mar 30 23:15:45 <Mac_LaBrea>	Keating was a piece of work
Mar 30 23:15:54 <payuirtuk>	who is teating?
Mar 30 23:16:01 <xina>	Maybe
Mar 30 23:16:36 <Mac_LaBrea>	the Ohio banker of "Keating Five" fame.  went to jail over the S&L scandal.
Mar 30 23:16:52 <Mac_LaBrea>	or infamy i should say
Mar 30 23:17:10 <xina>	Hm
Mar 30 23:17:18 <payuirtuk>	mmm
Mar 30 23:17:32 <Mac_LaBrea>	he was an big anti-porn crusader before he got caught
Mar 30 23:17:43 <xina>	Jerry was involved?
Mar 30 23:17:45 <payuirtuk>	but he was big into porn himself
Mar 30 23:18:21 <Mac_LaBrea>	no Jerry was not involved.  It was a misidentification on this thread. happens when we are reminsicing about the 80s
Mar 30 23:18:39 <Rocz>	It does.

Mar 30 23:24:37 <Mac_LaBrea>	hot sauce is great and all, but honey or honey mustard is the way to go with nuggets
