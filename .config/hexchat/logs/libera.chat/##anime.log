Nov 17 23:25:07 <amigojapan>	ah ok, DunceCotus , I forgot there was a new one
Nov 17 23:25:08 <britney>	actually, some people say that about the 90s one

Nov 20 00:02:10 <Urchin[emacs]>	:P
Nov 20 00:02:48 <MootPoot>	rusty bois
Nov 20 00:04:16 *	Urchin[emacs] shrugs
Nov 20 00:04:34 <Urchin[emacs]>	MootPoot: anyway, what about it?
Nov 20 00:04:57 <MootPoot>	nothing
Nov 20 00:05:05 <MootPoot>	nothing much ig
Nov 20 00:05:14 <MootPoot>	just how it was a fad that....didn't go very far
Nov 20 00:05:26 <MootPoot>	I have similar doubts about rust honestly
Nov 20 00:05:41 <aaabbb>	rust is getting popular
Nov 20 00:05:47 <aaabbb>	unlike ruby it's fast
Nov 20 00:06:04 <MootPoot>	yeah but the people saying that are like the linux on the desktop crowd
Nov 20 00:06:09 <MootPoot>	which gives me...doubts
Nov 20 00:06:36 *	Urchin[emacs] shrugs
Nov 20 00:06:37 <aaabbb>	but it's also being used by professionals
Nov 20 00:06:52 <aaabbb>	linux kernel devs, some of windows is rust, some of firefox and chrome is
Nov 20 00:07:07 <Urchin[emacs]>	while I use Linux on a desktop, it's a far cry from using a desktop distro
Nov 20 00:07:24 <MootPoot>	when I say linux on the desktop I mean the "this is the year of the linux desktop"
Nov 20 00:07:25 <MootPoot>	people
Nov 20 00:07:51 <aaabbb>	those people are memes
Nov 20 00:08:34 <MootPoot>	anyways, I figured it was time to maybe branch out a bit
Nov 20 00:08:47 <MootPoot>	I'm not sure what to pick
Nov 20 00:08:53 <MootPoot>	I used to do PHP....I don't want to do that anymore
Nov 20 00:08:54 <MootPoot>	lol
Nov 20 00:09:01 <aaabbb>	for a new lang to learn?
Nov 20 00:10:27 <MootPoot>	yeah
Nov 20 00:10:36 <MootPoot>	I mainline C#/Typescript these days
Nov 20 00:10:56 <aaabbb>	learn C then
Nov 20 00:11:51 <MootPoot>	yeah but with rust on there...idk
Nov 20 00:12:04 <MootPoot>	I'll consider that when we know its going to go one way or the other
Nov 20 00:12:19 <aaabbb>	C is good to learn because it teaches you low-level fundamentals
Nov 20 00:13:06 <MootPoot>	like what?
Nov 20 00:13:26 *	Kill-Animals has quit (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
Nov 20 00:13:41 <aaabbb>	handling memory, difference between stack and heap, bitwise ops, how strings are "Actually" handled by the cpu
Nov 20 00:14:49 <MootPoot>	those are just you normal CS degree topics
Nov 20 00:14:52 <MootPoot>	don't need to relearn those
Nov 20 00:15:03 <aaabbb>	already have a cs degree?
Nov 20 00:15:08 <MootPoot>	who dosen't
Nov 20 00:15:10 <aaabbb>	but you didn't learn any C?
Nov 20 00:15:35 <MootPoot>	we did it for a little bit just to go through those
Nov 20 00:15:45 <MootPoot>	but transitioned onto C# later for actual applications
Nov 20 00:15:53 <aaabbb>	do you want to learn low-level or high-level?
Nov 20 00:16:07 <MootPoot>	something that would be handy on a high level
Nov 20 00:16:12 <MootPoot>	so I have 2x motivation
Nov 20 00:16:24 <aaabbb>	maybe python then
Nov 20 00:17:15 <MootPoot>	bleh
Nov 20 00:17:19 <MootPoot>	don't like interpeted stuff
Nov 20 00:17:30 <MootPoot>	python is a glue langauge
Nov 20 00:17:46 <aaabbb>	compiled is (usually) lower level
Nov 20 00:17:56 <aaabbb>	i think rust then, it's extremely fast, compiled, and safe
Nov 20 00:18:24 <MootPoot>	yeah that's the thing
Nov 20 00:18:31 <MootPoot>	rust seems like the ideal choice
Nov 20 00:18:36 <MootPoot>	but its still in that grey no-mans land
Nov 20 00:18:38 <Urchin[emacs]>	python is at least half-decent glue
Nov 20 00:18:51 <MootPoot>	ig
Nov 20 00:19:05 <MootPoot>	but then again, "new object Object"
Nov 20 00:19:05 <MootPoot>	lol
Nov 20 00:19:08 <aaabbb>	MootPoot: even gcc is gonna add rust
Nov 20 00:19:16 <oni_00>	i want to learn programming but i have the worst memory. 
Nov 20 00:19:24 <Urchin[emacs]>	MootPoot: Lua?
Nov 20 00:19:52 <Urchin[emacs]>	MootPoot: F#? Scheme?
Nov 20 00:20:14 <Urchin[emacs]>	MootPoot: hell, check out Emacs Lisp :P
Nov 20 00:20:50 <MootPoot>	Isne't lua just a worse python for keyboards and shit
Nov 20 00:21:37 <Urchin[emacs]>	MootPoot: Lua is pretty popular for game scripting
Nov 20 00:21:49 <aaabbb>	learn perl lol
Nov 20 00:21:54 <MootPoot>	ew
Nov 20 00:22:10 <MootPoot>	Urchin[emacs]: yeah but for games to go to is python/C#
Nov 20 00:22:38 <aaabbb>	@dont = &you(\%love, $sigils{$lol})
Nov 20 00:22:43 *	MootPoot vomits
Nov 20 00:22:54 <MootPoot>	F#...well...I looked into it
Nov 20 00:22:59 <MootPoot>	lacks market penetration
Nov 20 00:23:06 <MootPoot>	no idea what scheme is
Nov 20 00:23:15 <MootPoot>	!g market penetration of rust
Nov 20 00:23:17 <ImoutoBot>	MootPoot: No results.
Nov 20 00:23:20 *	MootPoot bonks ImoutoBot

Nov 20 00:23:59 <MootPoot>	I mean..PHP exists
Nov 20 00:24:25 <Ingvix>	php is kinda comfy heap of trash
Nov 20 00:24:30 <MootPoot>	no
Nov 20 00:24:52 <MootPoot>	php is the same kind of nonsensicial shit that vanilla JS is 
Nov 20 00:24:55 <MootPoot>	keep that away from me
Nov 20 00:25:35 <MootPoot>	I can respect them both for chugging on day in and out, but I would not use it even if you paid me
Nov 20 00:25:45 <MootPoot>	I'd rather learn rust lol
Nov 20 00:25:57 <aaabbb>	learn intercal
Nov 20 00:26:02 <MootPoot>	I did rust for a bit but never really did any decently sized projects with it beyond basics
Nov 20 00:27:23 <MootPoot>	rust does have one major appeal to me though
Nov 20 00:28:00 <aaabbb>	so learn rust
Nov 20 00:28:18 <MootPoot>	its one language that can be used from embedded all the way to application tier
Nov 20 00:28:24 <MootPoot>	afaik C# embedded is.....uh

Nov 20 22:49:08 <farzat>	If my wife is hiding things from me even though it is very obvious to TOTAL STRANGERS that she's suffering
Nov 20 22:49:46 <farzat>	Then that means maybe she doesn't trust that I care about her to solve her problems?
Nov 20 22:50:07 <farzat>	Or maybe she thinks I'm incapable of helping her?
Nov 20 22:51:31 <farzat>	Or maybe I'd prefer to see her suffer by herself than take 具体的な actions to solve her suffering
Nov 20 22:52:29 <farzat>	Now you could say that this is cuz of how she was trained as a child
Nov 20 22:53:06 <farzat>	Well then train her again! Design a training to make her express herself and be less insecure

Nov 23 02:50:35 <DunceCotus>	amigojapan, yeah there's still the safety element one can insist upon

Nov 23 02:51:10 <DunceCotus>	amigojapan, I'd need their contact details
Nov 23 02:51:18 <DunceCotus>	cause otherwise all communication between us goes through the business
Nov 23 02:51:24 <amigojapan>	I see DunceCotus 
Nov 23 02:51:30 <DunceCotus>	capitalists know this amigojapan 
Nov 23 02:51:42 <DunceCotus>	they account for this in the sorts of jobs they produce
Nov 23 02:52:27 <DunceCotus>	amigojapan, workplace organisation invariably leads to unionisation
Nov 23 02:52:44 <amigojapan>	DunceCotus:  you could casualy ask for their contact when you are in business times "I have something personal to tell you"
Nov 23 02:52:48 <DunceCotus>	but through unionisation we kinda lose the potential of the 'refusal' insofar as it is a negotiation with power (the employer)
Nov 23 02:53:19 <DunceCotus>	amigojapan, its probably against company employment policy
Nov 23 02:53:33 <DunceCotus>	amigojapan, ironically I could do it without company knowing.. at the office
Nov 23 02:53:44 <amigojapan>	I see DunceCotus 
Nov 23 02:53:44 <DunceCotus>	but that presupposes everyone is working at the office on that day, and I don't think we should have to

Nov 23 02:54:24 <amigojapan>	I see
Nov 23 02:54:38 <DunceCotus>	I don't think its about convincing people or anything like that

Mar 29 00:12:19 <MootPoot>	welcome to the future
Mar 29 00:12:32 <MootPoot>	Aren't you still using a 1080p panel though

Mar 29 00:24:28 <Roey>	amigojapan: me too
Mar 29 00:24:31 <Roey>	I'm gonna go to bed
Mar 29 00:24:33 <amigojapan>	MootPoot: yeah, but i had the font super huge, now it can be way smaller

Mar 29 00:24:48 <amigojapan>	good night Roey o/
Mar 29 00:24:53 <Roey>	o/ :)
Mar 29 00:25:07 <amigojapan>	MootPoot: I could barely see
Mar 29 00:25:39 <amigojapan>	MootPoot: I think I was able to see so crisp when I was a kid, but I had forgotten it
Mar 29 00:25:59 <amigojapan>	MootPoot: my right eye is still bad too
Mar 29 00:27:05 <MootPoot>	amigojapan: well, if you look close at your 1080p model can you see the pixels?
Mar 29 00:27:12 <MootPoot>	can you see the jagged/rough edges?
Mar 29 00:27:21 <amigojapan>	yeah MootPoot , I can
Mar 29 00:27:30 <MootPoot>	Now imagine...those don't exist anymore
Mar 29 00:27:33 <MootPoot>	perfectly smooth
Mar 29 00:27:34 <MootPoot>	that's 4k
Mar 29 00:27:38 <amigojapan>	I see MootPoot 
Mar 29 00:28:01 <MootPoot>	so its easier to have a lot more content on your screen since it can be smaller
Mar 29 00:28:13 <amigojapan>	I see MootPoot 
Mar 29 00:28:14 <MootPoot>	more windows, more detail, etc etc
Mar 29 00:28:21 <MootPoot>	1080p is still fine if you're happy with it
Mar 29 00:28:31 <amigojapan>	gotcha
Mar 29 00:29:02 <MootPoot>	if all I did was live like Urchin[emacs] as a hermit who only lives in emacs and watches 1080p anime at most, 1080 would be fine
Mar 29 00:29:18 <amigojapan>	MootPoot: glasses would not have helped with cataracts tho, it was like a vail over my eyes, and also like a ball of fire in 3d, but all that is gobne
Mar 29 00:31:00 <Sapphirus>	4k anime isn't real
Mar 29 00:31:29 <MootPoot>	who said it was
Mar 29 00:31:46 <aaabbb>	a lot of 4k anime is just upscaled 1080p
Mar 29 00:32:01 <MootPoot>	all*
Mar 29 00:32:05 <aaabbb>	10bit is more important than 4k
Mar 29 00:32:12 <amigojapan>	hi aaabbb and Sapphirus 
Mar 29 00:32:16 <Sapphirus>	hello
Mar 29 00:32:17 <aaabbb>	hi amigojapan
Mar 29 00:32:24 <MootPoot>	anyways, so in new  linux news
Mar 29 00:32:27 <amigojapan>	MootPoot: I feel like my left eye is that of a new born baby
Mar 29 00:32:38 <MootPoot>	mint works with my dell thunderbolt dock!
Mar 29 00:32:48 <MootPoot>	scaling is still kind of borked though
Mar 29 00:32:54 <MootPoot>	I'll take whatever I can get
Mar 29 00:34:35 <aaabbb>	i want 8k so that i can look at the monitor with a magnifying glass
Mar 29 00:34:51 <MootPoot>	ever since I ditched that nvidia laptop my linux exprience has been so much more problem free
Mar 29 00:34:54 <aaabbb>	the only real way to watch anime is with a magnifying glass
Mar 29 00:34:54 <MootPoot>	its actually insane
Mar 29 00:34:59 <aaabbb>	MootPoot: nvidia suuuux
Mar 29 00:35:17 <MootPoot>	I don't think it was nvidia as much as specifically the mobile graphics implementation 
Mar 29 00:35:21 <MootPoot>	of nvidia
Mar 29 00:35:26 <MootPoot>	desktop nvidia users seem to be ok
Mar 29 00:35:59 <aaabbb>	wayland is sometimes iffy on nvidia
Mar 29 00:37:09 <MootPoot>	dumbass question but 
Mar 29 00:37:23 <MootPoot>	is there way to make the snap windows function on mint/cinnamon snap across monitors as well?
Mar 29 00:37:49 <MootPoot>	Konsole has been great
Mar 29 00:37:59 <MootPoot>	I haven't been Vim-ified yet, but I'm getting there
Mar 29 00:38:26 <aaabbb>	i don't use mint so idk actually
Mar 29 00:38:33 <MootPoot>	Is there any point of using Tmux if I use a tabbed console application?
Mar 29 00:38:39 <MootPoot>	with multi window and all of that
Mar 29 00:38:47 <aaabbb>	yeah
Mar 29 00:38:56 <aaabbb>	because tmux is more than just mutliple tabs
Mar 29 00:39:10 <MootPoot>	what else
Mar 29 00:39:12 <aaabbb>	it's also window panes, and it's an entirely new way of navigating
Mar 29 00:39:34 <aaabbb>	you can do a few key presses to search for a single word in any of the open virtual terminals
Mar 29 00:40:09 <MootPoot>	ooo
Mar 29 00:40:10 <MootPoot>	nice
Mar 29 00:40:18 <aaabbb>	and a loooot more
Mar 29 00:40:30 <aaabbb>	it's like vim where 99% of people only use 5% of its functionality
Mar 29 00:41:01 <aaabbb>	but the other 95% is amazing when you find out it exists
Mar 29 00:41:29 <aaabbb>	bookmarks, simple copy and paste without needing a mouse, quick searches, multiple possible tiling layouts
Mar 29 00:41:41 <aaabbb>	it's like a whole tiling window manager for command line
Mar 29 00:42:26 <aaabbb>	also you can detach it, so you can close the window, but it will still be there in the background, and then you can reattach it

Mar 29 00:44:03 *	ImoutoBot welcomes D​unceCotus (18 / 68): <D​unceCotus> fart-fuck your way to fictory
Mar 29 00:44:27 <MootPoot>	what do you mean detach
Mar 29 00:44:45 <MootPoot>	like you close the terminal window and then.....it just keeps going as a background process?
Mar 29 00:44:49 <MootPoot>	and you can call it back?>
Mar 29 00:45:19 <aaabbb>	you use the tmux detach command (ctrl-b and then d) and that basically makes tmux disappear and now you have just a regular terminal
Mar 29 00:45:29 <aaabbb>	now in any other terminal you can type "tmux a" and it comes back

Mar 29 00:49:01 <ImoutoBot>	[title] Tmux Cheat Sheet & Quick Reference | Session, window, pane and more
Mar 29 00:49:26 <aaabbb>	it looks complex but to use it at its basics, it's as simple as vim
Mar 29 00:49:32 <DunceCotus>	always awkward when you dream of a sexual fling with your friend's partner
Mar 29 00:50:20 <Sapphirus>	tmux is basically a terminal multiplexer 
Mar 29 00:50:39 <Urchin[emacs]>	eh, I learned screen before tmux existed
Mar 29 00:50:51 <Urchin[emacs]>	screen is more Emacs-like
Mar 29 00:50:53 <Sapphirus>	tmux is quite handy to have around.
Mar 29 00:51:15 <Sapphirus>	Daily drive it for my terminal applications and development environment
Mar 29 00:51:29 <airswing>	I love using it through SSH
Mar 29 00:51:49 <Sapphirus>	Got a plugin which allows me to restore the layout, so I can persist sessions -- for the most part -- between reboots.
Mar 29 00:51:53 <aaabbb>	it's absolutely indespensible with ssh
Mar 29 00:52:12 <airswing>	Managing a remote session of terminals without a perfect connection
Mar 29 00:52:14 <Sapphirus>	arswing, yeah, you can basically pickup where you left off on another machine without draining that machine's resources.
Mar 29 00:52:31 <PancakeMatsuri__>	Sapphirus, I've switched from screen to tmux, it was worth it
Mar 29 00:53:03 <PancakeMatsuri__>	saved windows was one of the perks of tmux
Mar 29 00:53:17 <rando25892>	theres a japanese config for screen as well
Mar 29 00:53:18 <Sapphirus>	Yeah, I don't think I could live without that now.
Mar 29 00:53:20 <aaabbb>	i tried screen but i couldn't get it to name windows
Mar 29 00:53:46 <Sapphirus>	Setup a session, two, or more; and then set them up the way I want them to be setup.

Mar 29 00:53:52 <Sapphirus>	It'd be a pain to have to do that every single time
Mar 29 00:54:09 <airswing>	It was useful in docker containers too. You just have to save the session in persistent memory
Mar 29 00:54:37 <Sapphirus>	Being able to restore those sessions and all the pane dimensions even comes in handy when you accidentally muck something up.
Mar 29 00:54:41 <Sapphirus>	Just hit the keybind to restore haha
Mar 29 00:55:35 <Sapphirus>	PancakeMatsuri__, plugin I use is called resurrect. 
Mar 29 00:55:53 *	MootPoot swapped to a XXL mouspad
Mar 29 00:56:45 <Sapphirus>	Takes a snapshot of your running sessions and it allows you to restore them and some of the applications.
Mar 29 00:57:18 <MootPoot>	I really like the adhesive polycarbonate mousepads
Mar 29 00:57:20 <MootPoot>	but they wear FAST
Mar 29 00:57:32 <MootPoot>	I go through one in ~6 months
Mar 29 00:57:54 <Sapphirus>	how are you destroying them
Mar 29 00:58:03 <MootPoot>	its plastic on plasic
Mar 29 00:58:07 <MootPoot>	they just wear down in spots
Mar 29 00:58:16 <MootPoot>	and then roughen up unevenly
Mar 29 00:58:41 <MootPoot>	My cloth pad back when I used to use one lasted like...a few years?
Mar 29 00:58:43 <Sapphirus>	Mine is like brand new after throwing it in the washing machine
Mar 29 00:59:00 <Sapphirus>	Just put it into a laundry bag to keep it safe
Mar 29 00:59:00 <MootPoot>	yeah, like I said, this isen't your grandpappys mousepad
Mar 29 00:59:07 <MootPoot>	it can't be washed
Mar 29 00:59:11 <Sapphirus>	that sux
Mar 29 00:59:16 <MootPoot>	its literally just a 2mm sheet of plastic with adhesive
Mar 29 00:59:18 <MootPoot>	that's it
Mar 29 00:59:21 <MootPoot>	and a super smooth top
Mar 29 00:59:27 <Sapphirus>	I vacuum mine and wash it like once a year
Mar 29 01:00:31 <Sapphirus>	Durability and texture is important to me. I don't want something that feels rough, but I don't want something that's so smooth it'll wear down.
Mar 29 01:00:47 <MootPoot>	you can get cloth pads with plastic in the cloth 
Mar 29 01:01:02 <MootPoot>	they last somewhat longer.....but as long as its plastic...it'll wear
Mar 29 01:01:21 <Sapphirus>	This clothpad is fine. It's a softer polyester.
Mar 29 01:01:41 <Sapphirus>	Got a water resistant coating, I think, too.
Mar 29 01:01:45 *	parahola has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
Mar 29 01:01:58 <Sapphirus>	Maybe it's not the coating so much as it is the fabric's texture
Mar 29 01:02:07 <Sapphirus>	Not too sure on that one. I'd have to look it up again.
Mar 29 01:02:32 <Sapphirus>	If it is a coating, I doubt if it's effective as it was when it was new.
Mar 29 01:03:45 <MootPoot>	ohh, that's nice
Mar 29 01:03:52 <MootPoot>	I can finally aim more consistently again
Mar 29 01:03:57 <MootPoot>	no more smooth spot and then rough spot
Mar 29 01:04:21 <MootPoot>	Sapphirus: if you do ever get a plastic pad - they also seem to wear out mouse feet much faster
Mar 29 01:04:26 <MootPoot>	buy spares
Mar 29 01:04:50 <MootPoot>	its like 30 bucks total every 8 months so w/e for me but its something to keep in mind
Mar 29 01:04:55 <Sapphirus>	Plastic on plastic sounds like a bad idea
Mar 29 01:05:30 <Sapphirus>	Even if polyester is technically a polymer-based fabric, it doesn't wear mice feet.
Mar 29 01:05:41 <Sapphirus>	Mine are in good condition still.
Mar 29 01:07:52 <MootPoot>	I want to migrate a lot of my stuff to mainly-console
Mar 29 01:08:00 <MootPoot>	company wants to swap to mac laptops
Mar 29 01:08:19 <MootPoot>	I'm not a super big fan given their UI is....annoying but if I can terminal everything I can work around it
Mar 29 01:09:30 <Sapphirus>	You'll be wanting to switch Linux even sooner than you think if you actually like terminal-based environments.
Mar 29 01:09:45 <Sapphirus>	lol

Mar 29 01:10:02 <MootPoot>	hey, if valve ever makes a proper SteamOS for the desktop release
Mar 29 01:10:04 <MootPoot>	arch based
Mar 29 01:10:07 <MootPoot>	I'm all on board
Mar 29 01:10:41 <Sapphirus>	I just run Steam on my Linux desktop just fine without SteamOS.
Mar 29 01:10:50 <Sapphirus>	proton and everything is as seamless as it'd be on the steamdeck
Mar 29 01:11:04 <MootPoot>	I've had lots of scaling problems
Mar 29 01:11:33 <Sapphirus>	Only place I have hidpi is on my laptop. I'm avoiding it on my desktop for the foreseeable future.
Mar 29 01:11:36 <MootPoot>	set it at 125% , quite a few games just.....don't launch
Mar 29 01:11:54 <MootPoot>	100% is a lil too small for me on this laptop dispaly
Mar 29 01:12:10 <MootPoot>	so I have to use 150 or 1250, but if I want to game go back and set it to 100%
Mar 29 01:12:14 <MootPoot>	otherwise insta-crash
Mar 29 01:12:20 <MootPoot>	sometimes takes the OS with it
Mar 29 01:12:32 *	MootPoot looks angrily at stellaris
Mar 29 01:12:53 <Sapphirus>	I've got scaling to work on my laptop at 150%, but I don't see it as necessary for screens that look crystal clear enough (1440p) at around three feet away (or an arm's length).
Mar 29 01:13:01 <Sapphirus>	Difference with a laptop is you're far closer to the screen usually.
Mar 29 01:13:50 <MootPoot>	I want to try eGPU with this linux install but I don't think that'll work very well
Mar 29 01:14:07 <MootPoot>	reading through fourms it seems that eGPUs are....nowhere near "plug n play"
Mar 29 01:14:23 <MootPoot>	I was inches from buying a 5700xt
Mar 29 01:14:32 <Sapphirus>	Good thing you didn't ahaha
Mar 29 01:14:55 <Sapphirus>	At least from the perspective of it being good for anything other than gaming and maybe Linux drivers.
Mar 29 01:15:08 <Sapphirus>	AMD really sucks when it comes to AI shit.
Mar 29 01:15:28 <Sapphirus>	Performance delta is huge between GPUs that have equivalent gaming performance.
Mar 29 01:15:29 <MootPoot>	I don't think I'll be doing any AI shit on this for a while
Mar 29 01:16:12 <MootPoot>	The more Ai stuff I use the more I'm convinced that its all bullshit
Mar 29 01:16:34 <MootPoot>	Sure, you can make art...that kinda all looks the same and bits are borked 
Mar 29 01:16:47 <Sapphirus>	You really have to know how to edge the prompts.
Mar 29 01:17:01 <Sapphirus>	I was able to get good unique output when I was playing around with stablediffusion 
Mar 29 01:17:37 <Sapphirus>	Although it just is an average of what an artist can do, anyway.
Mar 29 01:18:01 <MootPoot>	even for programming its just a shitty autocomplete
Mar 29 01:18:11 <rando25892>	it isnt drm ull be okay
Mar 29 01:18:34 <Sapphirus>	MootPoot, that's why I won't pay for copilot.
Mar 29 01:18:36 <MootPoot>	We're soon going to reach the point where AI bullshit is going to end up training on more AI busllthi
Mar 29 01:18:48 <MootPoot>	and its a endless loop of garbage in garbage out
Mar 29 01:18:50 <Sapphirus>	Devin is hilarious…
Mar 29 01:19:46 <Sapphirus>	copilot can't do much more than a good lsp can do apart from write boilerplate.
Mar 29 01:21:22 <MootPoot>	The fundamental problem with AI is that it can't be trusted/take responsibility for anything
Mar 29 01:24:12 <Sapphirus>	That's because it can't at this stage.
Mar 29 01:24:38 <MootPoot>	As long as it can't reason properly, it might as well be useless
Mar 29 01:24:44 <MootPoot>	and if it can reason properly, well - AGI?
Mar 29 01:25:20 <Sapphirus>	It's more that it's basically like a brain hooked to a bunch of electrodes with no driver at the steering wheel.
Mar 29 01:25:38 <Sapphirus>	It can't reason because it isn't conscious. 
Mar 29 01:25:51 <Sapphirus>	That's my stupid, ridiculous theory on the matter.

Mar 30 22:08:11 <Nanobot>	How to make stir-fry: 1. In a frying pan, add sesame oil, chicken thigh pieces, garlic salt, and pepper. Cook thoroughly 2. Move chicken to a small plate, and add bell peppers, carrots, green beans, and broccoli to frying pan. Salt well. Cook until.. I dunno.. hot, I guess. 3. Add chicken back to frying pan, and add teriyaki sauce. More teriyaki sauce. More. More. No, still more. Okay, good. Cook until the sauce has almost completely reduced. 4. Enjoy. 
Mar 30 22:08:11 <Nanobot>	Should probably drink a few gallons of water to counteract the salt.

Mar 30 22:20:23 <DunceCotus>	Nanobot, milk is far better for negating spicy vs. water
Mar 30 22:20:34 <ButterNoodle>	salt != spice
Mar 30 22:20:35 <Nanobot>	Teriyaki sauce and bell peppers are spicy?
Mar 30 22:20:38 <DunceCotus>	water does almost nothing for spicy
Mar 30 22:20:44 <DunceCotus>	Nanobot, to me yes
Mar 30 22:20:55 <ButterNoodle>	to ur butthole too?
Mar 30 22:21:00 <DunceCotus>	ButterNoodle, yes
Mar 30 22:21:04 <Nanobot>	If anything, bell peppers are sweet and a little bitter.
Mar 30 22:21:10 <DunceCotus>	wouldn't you like to be a butthole too
Mar 30 22:21:19 <ButterNoodle>	do u just eat apple sauce and bananas?
Mar 30 22:21:26 <Nanobot>	Teriyaki sauce is just sweet, umami, and salty.
Mar 30 22:21:28 <DunceCotus>	ButterNoodle, nah, too spicy
Mar 30 22:21:34 <ButterNoodle>	ic
Mar 30 22:21:45 <DunceCotus>	Nanobot, pepper = spicy
Mar 30 22:21:49 <DunceCotus>	there is no getting around that
Mar 30 22:22:05 *	ButterNoodle inserts the "are you sure about that" meme
Mar 30 22:22:06 <Nanobot>	Bell peppers, though? There's nothing spicy about fresh bell peppers.
Mar 30 22:22:22 <DunceCotus>	if it weren't spicy, it wouldn't be called peppers
Mar 30 22:22:35 <ButterNoodle>	its just the name of a plant
Mar 30 22:22:40 <Nanobot>	It's called a bell pepper because it's a type of pepper. Not all peppers are spicy.
Mar 30 22:22:58 <DunceCotus>	I'm pretty sensitive to spice
Mar 30 22:23:04 <ButterNoodle>	just like spider lilies are a plant more so than a spider
Mar 30 22:23:09 <DunceCotus>	I'll have the milk on hand just in case
Mar 30 22:23:31 <ButterNoodle>	what happens when ur out of kangaroo milk tho
Mar 30 22:23:39 <DunceCotus>	ButterNoodle, peppers all contain capsaicin iirc
Mar 30 22:23:42 <Nanobot>	If you have milk on hand, you have a wet hand.
Mar 30 22:23:44 <ButterNoodle>	arent all Australians lactose intolerant
Mar 30 22:23:55 <ButterNoodle>	Nanobot: a smelly wet hand
Mar 30 22:24:02 <DunceCotus>	ButterNoodle, almond milk
Mar 30 22:24:16 <DunceCotus>	my hand is fitted with milk compartments
Mar 30 22:24:25 <ButterNoodle>	thats more nut juice than milk tho
Mar 30 22:24:35 <Nanobot>	From Wikipedia: "The bell pepper is the only member of the genus Capsicum that does not produce capsaicin"
Mar 30 22:24:47 <DunceCotus>	oh fuck off wikipedia
Mar 30 22:25:06 <ButterNoodle>	and physically incapable of removing capsaicin from ur tongue and dick tip

Apr 02 00:24:04 <amigojapan>	Hi rsonx !
Apr 02 00:24:17 <amigojapan>	rsonx: can you take a nap?
Apr 02 00:24:21 <Sapphirus>	amigojapan, I suppose that's better than having no vision, at all.
Apr 02 00:24:56 <amigojapan>	Right definitely Sapphirus and it is still better than before the surgery 
Apr 02 00:25:13 <Sapphirus>	Correct, so it's the lesser of the evils.
Apr 02 00:25:22 <amigojapan>	Right
Apr 02 00:26:13 <amigojapan>	I wonder how multifocal lenses work...
Apr 02 00:26:38 <amigojapan>	It's like magic
Apr 02 00:27:24 <rsonx>	amigojapan: I wish I could take a nap. I Have to take a test in afternoon.
Apr 02 00:27:51 <amigojapan>	Ah I see rsonx 
Apr 02 00:28:05 <rsonx>	eyes are very sensitive after surgery. they need to take special care for some time.
Apr 02 00:28:55 <amigojapan>	rsonx: yeah I got 3 kind of eye drops and antibiotic pills 
Apr 02 00:29:19 <rsonx>	It is advisable that you get a sunglass and no screen.
Apr 02 00:29:41 <amigojapan>	I see
Apr 02 00:30:07 <rsonx>	when my grandfather had a cataract surgery doctor said no TV and to use sunglass all the time.
Apr 02 00:30:39 <amigojapan>	rsonx: my doctor did not say that
Apr 02 00:32:55 <amigojapan>	I'm not in the sun much tho 
Apr 02 00:34:28 <rsonx>	amigojapan: not just the sun's but all the lights can affect eyes. you would need less exposure to light. 
Apr 02 00:34:49 <rsonx>	If I remember correctly my gf used sunglasses all the time.
