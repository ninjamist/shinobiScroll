Nov 13 14:50:50 *	-  
Nov 13 14:50:50 *	- Molybdenum has been known throughout history, though its
Nov 13 14:50:50 *	- properties meant that it was confused with lead ores. It was
Nov 13 14:50:50 *	- first identified as a distinct element in 1778, meaning our
Nov 13 14:50:50 *	- modern understanding of its existence reaches about as far
Nov 13 14:50:50 *	- back as American independence.
Nov 13 14:50:50 *	-  
Nov 13 14:50:50 *	- Molybdenum has a very high melting point, 2623°C, the fifth-
Nov 13 14:50:50 *	- highest temperature of any element.
Nov 13 14:50:50 *	-  
Nov 13 14:50:50 *	- While pure molybdenum is only about as strong as tooth enamel,
Nov 13 14:50:50 *	- it forms strong alloys that are resistant to corrosion and
Nov 13 14:50:50 *	- stable under varying temperatures. As a result, these alloys
Nov 13 14:50:50 *	- are used for metal armour plates, high-performance aircraft
Nov 13 14:50:50 *	- parts, and pumps for molten metal flows.
Nov 13 14:50:50 *	-  
Nov 13 14:50:50 *	- In its elemental form, it can be used as a fertiliser, and the
Nov 13 14:50:50 *	- isotope molybdenum-99 is used as a source of technetium-99m,
Nov 13 14:50:50 *	- an important medical radioisotope used for 3D bone scans and
Nov 13 14:50:50 *	- the investigation of blood flow when diagnosing heart disease.

Nov 16 13:37:55 *	- Known since antiquity, Mercury is a heavy, liquid metal
Nov 16 13:37:55 *	- element at room temperature - the only such element. Despite
Nov 16 13:37:55 *	- the wide ranging use, mercury is a relatively rare element,
Nov 16 13:37:55 *	- though this is mitigated by its ore deposits tending to be
Nov 16 13:37:55 *	- highly concentrated.
Nov 16 13:37:55 *	-  
Nov 16 13:37:55 *	- The uses of mercury include medical applications such as
Nov 16 13:37:55 *	- dental amalgams, topical antiseptic compounds, and blood
Nov 16 13:37:55 *	- pressure meters.  Outside of medicine, mercury can be found
Nov 16 13:37:55 *	- in telescopes to form flat mirror surfaces, as well as
Nov 16 13:37:55 *	- parabolic surfaces when their container is spun. Mercury has
Nov 16 13:37:55 *	- historically and continues to be used in many other

Nov 20 22:44:35 *	- -[ Molybdenum ]-[ Atomic number: 42 ]-[ Chemical symbol: Mo ]-
Nov 20 22:44:35 *	-  
Nov 20 22:44:35 *	- Molybdenum has been known throughout history, though its
Nov 20 22:44:35 *	- properties meant that it was confused with lead ores. It was
Nov 20 22:44:35 *	- first identified as a distinct element in 1778, meaning our
Nov 20 22:44:35 *	- modern understanding of its existence reaches about as far
Nov 20 22:44:35 *	- back as American independence.
Nov 20 22:44:35 *	-  
Nov 20 22:44:35 *	- Molybdenum has a very high melting point, 2623°C, the fifth-
Nov 20 22:44:35 *	- highest temperature of any element.
Nov 20 22:44:35 *	-  
Nov 20 22:44:35 *	- While pure molybdenum is only about as strong as tooth enamel,
Nov 20 22:44:35 *	- it forms strong alloys that are resistant to corrosion and
Nov 20 22:44:35 *	- stable under varying temperatures. As a result, these alloys
Nov 20 22:44:35 *	- are used for metal armour plates, high-performance aircraft
Nov 20 22:44:35 *	- parts, and pumps for molten metal flows.
Nov 20 22:44:35 *	-  
Nov 20 22:44:35 *	- In its elemental form, it can be used as a fertiliser, and the
Nov 20 22:44:35 *	- isotope molybdenum-99 is used as a source of technetium-99m,
Nov 20 22:44:35 *	- an important medical radioisotope used for 3D bone scans and
Nov 20 22:44:35 *	- the investigation of blood flow when diagnosing heart disease.

Feb 24 01:22:37 *	-  
Feb 24 01:22:37 *	- Molybdenum has been known throughout history, though its
Feb 24 01:22:37 *	- properties meant that it was confused with lead ores. It was
Feb 24 01:22:37 *	- first identified as a distinct element in 1778, meaning our
Feb 24 01:22:37 *	- modern understanding of its existence reaches about as far
Feb 24 01:22:37 *	- back as American independence.
Feb 24 01:22:37 *	-  
Feb 24 01:22:37 *	- Molybdenum has a very high melting point, 2623°C, the fifth-
Feb 24 01:22:37 *	- highest temperature of any element.
Feb 24 01:22:37 *	-  
Feb 24 01:22:37 *	- While pure molybdenum is only about as strong as tooth enamel,
Feb 24 01:22:37 *	- it forms strong alloys that are resistant to corrosion and
Feb 24 01:22:37 *	- stable under varying temperatures. As a result, these alloys
Feb 24 01:22:37 *	- are used for metal armour plates, high-performance aircraft
Feb 24 01:22:37 *	- parts, and pumps for molten metal flows.
Feb 24 01:22:37 *	-  
Feb 24 01:22:37 *	- In its elemental form, it can be used as a fertiliser, and the
Feb 24 01:22:37 *	- isotope molybdenum-99 is used as a source of technetium-99m,
Feb 24 01:22:37 *	- an important medical radioisotope used for 3D bone scans and
Feb 24 01:22:37 *	- the investigation of blood flow when diagnosing heart disease.

May 13 02:19:29 *	-  
May 13 02:19:29 *	- Molybdenum has been known throughout history, though its
May 13 02:19:29 *	- properties meant that it was confused with lead ores. It was
May 13 02:19:29 *	- first identified as a distinct element in 1778, meaning our
May 13 02:19:29 *	- modern understanding of its existence reaches about as far
May 13 02:19:29 *	- back as American independence.
May 13 02:19:29 *	-  
May 13 02:19:29 *	- Molybdenum has a very high melting point, 2623°C, the fifth-
May 13 02:19:29 *	- highest temperature of any element.
May 13 02:19:29 *	-  
May 13 02:19:29 *	- While pure molybdenum is only about as strong as tooth enamel,
May 13 02:19:29 *	- it forms strong alloys that are resistant to corrosion and
May 13 02:19:29 *	- stable under varying temperatures. As a result, these alloys
May 13 02:19:29 *	- are used for metal armour plates, high-performance aircraft
May 13 02:19:29 *	- parts, and pumps for molten metal flows.
May 13 02:19:29 *	-  
May 13 02:19:29 *	- In its elemental form, it can be used as a fertiliser, and the
May 13 02:19:29 *	- isotope molybdenum-99 is used as a source of technetium-99m,
May 13 02:19:29 *	- an important medical radioisotope used for 3D bone scans and
May 13 02:19:29 *	- the investigation of blood flow when diagnosing heart disease.
