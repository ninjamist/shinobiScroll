Possessing vast magical powers, the Adversary can manipulate reality, energy, and matter, cast illusions, and teleport. He is capable of opening portals to other dimensions and is virtually immortal. His most notable conflict involves tricking Forge, a mutant inventor and shaman, into opening a portal that allowed him to enter Earth&apos;s dimension. The Adversary&apos;s ultimate goal is to bring about the end of the world, seeing destruction as a form of creative renewal. He battles the X-Men on several occasions, viewing them as significant obstacles to his chaotic designs. His appearance is often depicted as a shifting amalgam of various demonic forms, symbolizing his chaotic nature and ability to change shape at will.\n\nFOLLOW ME HERE!\n▸ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/ComicsExplainedSub\n▸ Twitter: http://twitter.com/Comicsexplained\n▸ Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/comicsexplained\n\nVideos Everyone Loves:\n▸ New To Invincible?
